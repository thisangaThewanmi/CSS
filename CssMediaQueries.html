-CSS Media Queries
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

CSS Media Types
Value	                    Description
all                        	Used for all media type devices
print	                    Used for print preview mode
screen	                    Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.


CSS Common Media Features
Here are some commonly used media features:

Value	                    Description
orientation	                Orientation of the viewport. Landscape or portrait
max-height	                Maximum height of the viewport
min-height	                Minimum height of the viewport
height	                    Height of the viewport (including scrollbar)
max-width	                Maximum width of the viewport
min-width	                Minimum width of the viewport
width	                    Width of the viewport (including scrollbar)

Media Query Syntax
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more media features, which resolve to either true or false.

@media not|only mediatype and (media feature) and (media feature) {
  CSS-Code;
}


The mediatype is optional (if omitted, it will be set to all). However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a mediatype.

The result of the query is true if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all media features in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.




Meaning of the not, only, and and keywords:

not: This keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query.

only: This keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.

and: This keyword combines a media type and one or more media features.->
